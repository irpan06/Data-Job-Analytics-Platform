# Data Engineering

## Overview
> _This section documents the complete data engineering implementation of the project, covering data preparation, warehouse design, ETL development, orchestration, and monitoring._

## Architecture
![architecture](/images/architecture.png)

The data engineering pipeline adopts the **Medallion Architecture** to progressively transform raw operational data into business-ready datasets. Raw data is first loaded into the Bronze layer, refined into analytical tables in the Silver layer, and finally aggregated into Gold data marts for reporting and analytics.

## Directory Structure
The **de_engineering** module contains all components required to build the data engineering pipeline, from source data preparation to data warehouse creation and ETL execution.

### Directory Description

| Directory | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **data_preparation** | Prepares the raw dataset by downloading, splitting, creating the PostgreSQL database, and ingesting CSV files into the operational database. |
| **setup_ddl** | Contains SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts used to create the ClickHouse warehouse schema, including Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. |
| **etl_dml** | Contains SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) scripts that implement the ETL process across the Medallion Architecture. |
| **scripts** | Provides Python entry-point scripts to build the warehouse and execute the end-to-end ETL pipeline. |
